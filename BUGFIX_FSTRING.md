# Bug Fix: F-String Handling in String Obfuscation

## Issue Description

The string obfuscation technique was incorrectly processing f-strings (formatted string literals), causing syntax errors in the obfuscated code. The regex pattern was matching parts of f-strings and attempting to encode them, which broke the f-string syntax.

### Example of the Problem

**Original Code:**
```python
print(f"Success rate: {success_rate:.2f}%")
```

**Broken Obfuscated Code:**
```python
print(f"Success rate: {success_rate:.2f}%''.join([chr(char_code) for char_code in [41, 10, ...]])Pipeline error: {e}''.join([chr(char_code) for char_code in [41, 10, ...]])__main__":
```

## Root Cause

The string obfuscation regex pattern was:
1. Matching string literals inside f-strings
2. Not properly handling the boundaries of f-string expressions
3. Creating malformed syntax by injecting obfuscated code into f-string literals

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced F-String Detection

Modified the string obfuscation methods to process code line by line and skip any lines containing f-strings:

```python
lines = code.split('\n')
result_lines = []

for line in lines:
    # Skip lines that contain f-strings to avoid breaking them
    if 'f"' in line or "f'" in line:
        result_lines.append(line)
    else:
        # Apply string obfuscation to non-f-string lines
        pattern = r'(?<!f)(["\'])([^"\'\\]*(?:\\.[^"\'\\]*)*)\1(?!\1)'
        processed_line = re.sub(pattern, replace_string, line)
        result_lines.append(processed_line)

return '\n'.join(result_lines)
```

### 2. Improved Regex Pattern

Updated the regex pattern to better exclude f-strings:
- `(?<!f)` - Negative lookbehind to exclude f-strings
- `(?!\1)` - Negative lookahead to avoid triple quotes

### 3. Fixed Variable Name Conflicts

Corrected variable name conflicts in the character encoding:
```python
# Before (caused variable shadowing)
return f"''.join([chr({code}) for code in [{', '.join(char_codes)}]])"

# After (fixed variable name)
return f"''.join([chr(char_code) for char_code in [{', '.join(char_codes)}]])"
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix
```python
# Syntax Error - Malformed f-string
print(f"Success rate: {success_rate:.2f}%''.join([chr(char_code) for char_code in [41, 10, ...]])
```

### After Fix
```python
# F-string preserved, other strings obfuscated
name = ''.join([chr(char_code) for char_code in [65, 108, 105, 99, 101]])  # "Alice"
message = f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."  # F-string preserved
regular_string = bytes.fromhex('54686973206973206120726567756c617220737472696e67').decode()  # Obfuscated
```

### Validation
- ✅ F-strings are preserved and functional
- ✅ Regular strings are properly obfuscated
- ✅ Code syntax remains valid
- ✅ Program functionality is maintained

## Applied to Methods

The fix was applied to:
1. `encode_strings()` - Basic string encoding
2. `advanced_encoding()` - Advanced string encoding with multiple methods

## Impact

- **Compatibility**: F-strings now work correctly in obfuscated code
- **Functionality**: All test cases pass
- **Robustness**: More sophisticated pattern matching
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more understandable code structure

## Recommendations

For future enhancements:
1. Consider implementing proper AST-based string replacement for more precise control
2. Add support for obfuscating the content within f-strings while preserving syntax
3. Implement more sophisticated f-string detection for edge cases
4. Add comprehensive test coverage for various string literal formats

This fix ensures that the obfuscator can handle modern Python code with f-strings while maintaining effective string obfuscation for other string literals.
